 A partial mock can be used to mock and stub methods on real objects, which otherwise
 act as normal objects. Stubbing can be used to return canned values from real objects
 (handy if you are unable to inject a mock in it's place).
 
 You do not generally need to call this method manually although you may if you wish.
 You can set up expectations on real objects directly and a partial mock will be 
 created automatically.
 
 In addition, any stubs configured on a partial mock will still be handled when the
 stubbed method is called directly on the original object.

 bridged classes (NSString, NSArray, NSNumber etc.).

 Mocky provides a macro, assertContextSatisfied(context) that should be called in place
